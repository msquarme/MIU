<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Questions</h3>

> Q1. Define a class called CalAge. This class is used to calculate age of a person from her or his date of birth and the current date. Include a mutator method that allows the user to enter her or his date of birth and set the value for current date. Also include a method to return the age in years and months (for example, 25.5 years) as a double value. Include an additional method to check if the date of birth entered by the user is a valid one. For example, 30 February 2008 is an invalid date. Embed your class in a test program.

> Q2. Define a class called WordCount whose objects count the number of words in a sentence. An object of this class maintains a variable count that is a nonnegative integer. Include methods to set the counter to 0, to increase the count by 1, and to decrease the count by 1 if any word encountered starts with ‘A’ or ‘a’. Be sure that no method allows the value of the counter to become negative. Include an accessor method that returns the current count value and a method that outputs the count to the screen. There should be no input method or other mutator methods. The only method that can set the counter is the one that sets it to 0. Write a main class with a main method to test your class (WordCount).

> Q3. Write a grading program for a class with the following grading policies: a. There are three quizzes, each graded on the basis of 10 points. b. There is one midterm exam, graded on the basis of 100 points. c. There is one final exam, graded on the basis of 100 points. The final exam counts for 40% of the grade. The midterm counts for 35% of the grade. The three quizzes together count for a total of 25% of the grade. (Do not forget to convert the quiz scores to percentages before they are averaged in.) Any grade of 90 or more is an A, any grade of 80 or more (but less than 90) is a B, any grade of 70 or more (but less than 80) is a C, any grade of 60 or more (but less than 70) is a D, and any grade below 60 is an F. The program should read in the student’s scores and output the student’s record, which consists of three quiz scores and two exam scores, as well as the student’s overall numeric score for the entire course and final letter grade.
