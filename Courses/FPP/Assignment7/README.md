> Q1. Design and code a Swing GUI to translate text that is input in English into Pig Latin. You can assume that the sentence contains no punctuation. The rules for Pig Latin are as follows:

 - For words that begin with consonants, move the leading consonant to the end of the word and add "ay." Thus, "ball" becomes "allbay"; "button" becomes "uttonbay"; and so forth. 
 - For words that begin with vowels, add "way" to the end of the word. Thus, "all" becomes "allway"; "one" becomes "oneway"; and so forth.

> Q2. Develop a simple number game using swing that will display nine buttons displayed in a 3:3 game board. 
* Nine random numbers will be generated, one corresponding to each button. 
* The numbers can be anything in the range of 1 to 50.
* The buttons will be initially blank, and the player will be asked to select any three buttons. 

As soon as the player selects a button, the corresponding number should be displayed at the bottom of the frame, finally displaying all three numbers selected by the player. 
- If one of the numbers selected is odd, the player gets a prize of $20; 
- If two are odd, the player gets a prize of $50; and 
- If all three numbers are odd, the player gets a prize of $100. Also,
- If any of the three selected numbers is 50, then there will be a bumper prize of $1000. 
- If any even number is selected, then the system should output "Better Luck Next Time!".

> Q3. Design and code a Swing GUI calculator.

Your calculator will have two text fields that the user cannot change: One labeled "Result" will contain the result of performing the operation, and the other labeled "Operand" will be for the user to enter a number to be added, subtracted, and so forth from the result. 

The user enters the number for the "Operand" text field by clicking buttons labeled with the digits 0 through 9 and a decimal point, just as in a real calculator.

Allow the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

When the user clicks a button for an operation, the following occurs: 
the operation is performed, the "Result" text field is updated, and the "Operand" text field is cleared. 
Include a button labeled "Reset" that resets the "Result" to 0.0. Also
include a button labeled "Clear" that resets the "Operand" text field so it is blank.
